A collection of drum notation for popular grooves.

Grooves can be played and will animate using tabular and wheel visualisations.

The goal is to gather a huge collection of popular grooves, so please feel free to contribute extra grooves or provide corrections to existing ones [here](https://github.com/bobbyrne01/play-along/issues).
